                    Inazuma Eleven GO is an RPG action/sport based game. Whilst not in match mode, you can control the 
                    character set as the first person to go where you want them them to go with either the circle-pad, 
                    control-pad or with the stylus. You can change the view of the top screen using the L and R buttons on 
                    the top left and right of the Nintendo 3DS, to make it easier to find items and other necessity's. Along 
                    with the person you are walking and talking to people with, you can have two other characters walking/running 
                    behind you. Although, when you run into a soccer battle, you play with the first five players listed in your team 
                    (which can be changed).<br /><br />
                    Whilst you are playing a team in a soccer match, you control your team using the stylus, 
                    drawing blue arrows to tell them where to go, in which they start to run there. You can pass to members of 
                    your team by tapping on the bottom screen where you want the ball to go; if you tap it near to a player, but 
                    not to them, they will quickly sprint to that place. On the right side of the bottom screen, you can see a Hand, 
                    a T sign, a 化 (Keshin) sign, which are all options to help you through the match. The hand option is to pause the 
                    match, in which then you can draw arrows for players to move to and say where to pass the ball. The T option lets you 
                    use a Hissatsu Tactics. Hissatsu Tactics help you get to certain places on the pitch without interacting with the opposing 
                    team, or can help you get the ball back. New in Inazuma Eleven GO are Keshin, manifestations of ones spiritual energy. 
                    Keshin are powerful beings that can use skills and specialized hissatsu, and while they are active the user experiences 
                    a boost in strength, making shooting, dribbling, and blocking, among other things, vastly increasing their all around effectiveness.
